My name is Andy Diep. 

### My story
Hello, and welcome to my website! 

I am a Microsoft Office Tutor at Cal Poly Pomona, where I guide students through Word, Excel, and PowerPoint problems while answering any questions they may have about concepts and challenges they encounter. I regularly report to the corresponding instructor, informing them of students' challenges and providing suggestions for curriculum design.

In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, including my Homelab, where I experiment with containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. I have configured Pfsense, an open-source firewall and routing platform, and independently hosted applications such as a DNS sinkhole, personal cloud storage, and password manager through Docker containers hosted through on-premises servers. I have also worked on the Speakers Website project, where I created a DevOps CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy a Next.js application on Netlify, developed an Azure Functions workflow that calls Contentful (CMS) with GitHub actions to deploy to Azure Cloud, and provisioned Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) on Azure to deploy all resources in the subscription.

### Career aspiration

As a Engineer, my career aspirations are focused on continually improving my skills and knowledge in the field. I am passionate about staying up-to-date on the latest tools and technologies to optimize and automate workflows, as well as developing innovative solutions to complex problems.

In the future, I hope to lead and mentor teams to drive successful outcomes for organizations, leveraging my technical expertise and project management skills. I believe that DevOps is not just about technology, but also about building collaborative relationships and fostering a culture of continuous improvement. Ultimately, my goal is to make a meaningful impact by delivering high-quality, reliable solutions that meet the needs of both customers and stakeholders.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you find the information provided here informative and helpful.
